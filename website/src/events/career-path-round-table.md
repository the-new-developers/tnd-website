Applying or planning to apply for co-ops? Need some advice or want to hear about how othersâ€™ coop experiences are? 

Front-end, back-end, full-stack, data science, business intelligence, what do you want to do after graduation? Are you interested in one specific field and want to know more?

We have invited alumni and higher-semester students. Come talk to our guests who were in our spot not long ago. Ask how they got to where they are now, and what the gap is between college education and employment, or ask suggestions to better ourselves for a future job.


We'll be meeting up in the Event Hall channel in our Discord server on Wednesday, November 17 at 7:00 pm.
See you there!
