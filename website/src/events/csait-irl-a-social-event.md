Couldn't get enough last September? Ready to relive the memories of choice tunes, drink specials, and camaraderie with classmates and faculty? Come to The Cellar on Wednesday, February 5th for the encore of CSAIT IRL! From 6-10 pm we've rented out the excellent bar at the back of the Arnie for software and networking students and faculty only. Come make some new friends, reconnect with classmates from other semesters and CSAIT programs, chat with your instructors, learn about other tech clubs on campus, and get to know the people you take class with.

While this is _not_ a 19+ required event, IDs (or passports for international students) will be checked for those of you imbibing alcoholic beverages.
