**What is mob programming?**

Here is a short video explaining mob programming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pno_RBd4Uu0&ab_channel=EyeonTech

Mob programming is similar to pair programming but with larger teams. Students will be broken into mobs (teams) of 3-6 students (depending on the turnout). Each team consists of three roles:

Driver - the person who is on the keyboard working\
Navigator - provides the driver with high level instructions and assistance if they need help\
Mob - support the driver and navigator if they need help

A timer is running throughout the mobbing time with positions rotating every 3-4 mins so each member gets to experience each role. People new to programming get help from more experienced people, and people with more experience get practice helping and communicating with newer programmers. We will have students who are familiar with mobbing acting as a mob lead to make sure everything runs smoothly.
