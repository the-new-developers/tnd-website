We've picked what we'll be building and how we'll build and deploy it, now we need to outline the steps we're going to take to see this through.

To help with this, we'll be bringing in Weever dev Jess Nguyen to explain how to take something of a loose specification and write good tickets against it.

We'll be meeting up in our usual spot - the Foobar-Voice channel of our Discord server, 7:00pm sharp.

See you there!
