This will be our very first official project meeting. We'll meet up in the #Foobar Voice channel on our Discord, go over the plan ([which you can view here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5N_18ADE8leDwU36WrTypmw_GxB52aU-CtJZZDErWk/edit?usp=sharing)), and finally answer any questions you might have.

Please make sure to at least skim the plan beforehand, and if you have any questions [check our little FAQ here](https://thenewdevelopers.com/2021-04-25-project-foobar/) to see if we might have already answered them.
