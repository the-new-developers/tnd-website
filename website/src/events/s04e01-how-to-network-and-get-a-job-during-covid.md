Getting a job is probably the primary reason we all went into this program, and next week we're bringing in a special guest to share their experience on how they found employment in what every corporation on the planet calls These Unprecedented Times™️.

[Wren Chen](https://twitter.com/wrenzchen) is a UI/UX Developer at Reliq Health, and a 2019 graduate of Sheridan College's Interactive Media Management program. We'll be bringing them [on our Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thenewdevelopers) next week to ask them about their experience looking for work, the challenges they faced and any advice they might have for us. 

You’re probably familiar with how these events run, so strap on your pajamas and we’ll see you in your office!
