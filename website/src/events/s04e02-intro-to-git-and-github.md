Learn the basics of Git with a hands-on workshop where you'll make your own contributions to a group code repository (and learn what the heck a repository is).

This workshop will be hosted directly in [The New Developers' Discord server](https://bit.ly/tnd-discord), lead by Mohawk CSAIT alum and Reliq Health dev Jen Armstrong.

Important: please make sure to [check out the instructions here](https://github.com/the-new-developers/jens-cool-guy-git-workshop) to see what you need to have set up before the event (spoilers: you'll need to install Git for this).

If you need help setting anything up, the TND team will be online at 6:30pm to assist.
