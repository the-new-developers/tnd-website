We're having a party at The Cellar on the Mohawk Fennell Campus, and **ALL** CSAIT students and faculty are invited! The merriment bursts forth at 7:00 pm on Thursday, September 19th, sweeping away all in its path until 11:00 pm -- at which moment a winning name will be drawn in our illustrious, esteemed, awe-inspiring 50/50 draw! (50/50 tickets can be purchased from Jen, Rodney or Andrew. Or email us: contact@thenewdevelopers.com)

There will be **FREE NACHOS** for all (until they run out!) and plenty of opportunities to win mysterious, irresistible, death-defying prizes (some worth more than a whole dollar!) in our captivating, ferocious, incomprehensible Trivia Challenge! Most of all, there will be uplifting, soul-cleansing, fever-inducing music, a noble bar selling glorious drinks, and... **PEOPLE!** 

Come meet your classmates, your profs, your networking/software counterparts, students in other semesters, and reps from other clubs like WITT, Cyber-Security and the Game Dev Club. Get info on planned events by those clubs and ours, get inside info from your profs, and make some friends, **IF YOU DARE!**

No registration necessary; all CSAIT students are welcome!
