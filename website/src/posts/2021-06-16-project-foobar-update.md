Just a quick little update:

After a [spirited brainstorming session](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l_DQQsk=/), the crew voted on [GATE HOPPER](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6F3SoGLlpuaRyIN1mJzzHHQk2hD4xlzw1VyUjPQiEU/edit) as the game we'll be building.

We also decided to build this as a client-side-only application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We might use some sort of JS library to help with any animations, but haven't decided on that quite yet. 

In terms of deployment, we'll try using Github Pages.
